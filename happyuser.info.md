Tasks 

1 - Products databases sorted. I will upload the databases that I have selected from the parsed databases. With explanation about key columns and so on.

2 - Implement this basic index-table database-connection  functionalities into YII framework.

3 - Develop a search-tool based on the tables, databases logic proposed in the attached Doc and picture + some talks.
By a plain HTML interface we will have search tool and an area to show results. In this way we can test logic and connections are properly working.

4 - When the search tool is done we start with the filtering-tool
Mock ups has been done for devices and parts.

5 - When filtering-tool is up and running and tested in the same way we have tested search tool. A simple HTML in which we can find a product by 
1 - search-tool 
or
2 - by filtering-tool
or combination of both.

.... then we can start with browsing-left-panel-tool.
